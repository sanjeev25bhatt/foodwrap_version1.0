NOTE 1:	i have set some parameters in the database.
			1: online column in the admin table denotes 
				0: means admin is offline
				10: means admin is online and connected with 0 users
				11: means admin is online and connected with 1 users
				12: means admin is online and connected with 2 users
				13: means admin is online and connected with 3 users
			
			2: now comes the admin_status table, once an admin is selected by a specific user, this table is updated
				u11, u12, u13 contains the id of the connected user respectively.

				
				
NOTE 2: user will be able to recieve online chat support if
			1: there is an admin online, in case admin is offline or he is already chatting with 3 users then user will recieve a message "no chat rooms available". 
			2: admin is chatting with either no user, one user or two user.
	
			when user click on 'find admin' button, an ajax request is send to find_admin.php, which checks the status of the admin on the basis of above 
			parameters and provides free admin id to the user. At the same time find_admin.php does one more thing, it stores the id of the user to the column
			u11 or u12 or u13. Which in turn is used by the admin to recieve messages from the user.
		

	
NOTE 3:	to check the status of admin and how the values are altered in the database.
			1: suppose initially admin status is offline (i.e value in online column will be 0 and u11, u12, u13 will also be 0).
			2: if user logs in then his state will become 10 (i.e. he is online but connected with 0 users).
			3: if a user say 'aman' is connected with admin via 'find admin' button then the status of admin will become 11.
			4: if some second user will get connected to admin then admin status will be updated to 12 and similarly 13 when third user will get connected. 
			5: if admin closes the window, then admin session will expire and hence he can't chat anymore.
				-> when the session of admin expires then 
					(a): the online column of the admin table will become 0 (i.e '0' indicates that admin is offline now)
					(b): u11, u12, u13 of admin-status will become 0 (i.e '0' for u11 u12 and u13 indicates that no users are connected with the admin).
			6: if admin relodes a window same will occurs.
			7: since the session of the admin is expired hence he has to login again.
